This specification does not address how this assessment is determined. This property is primarily to allow such usage without requiring the addition of a custom property for such practices. This property can support different use cases and requirements of a producing or consuming entity. For example, two playbook objects focused on the same malware could use the priority property to indicate that the execution of a remediation playbook is preferred compared to a mitigation playbook. \n\nIf specified, the value of this property MUST be between 0 and 100. \n\nWhen left blank this means unspecified.

Values range from 1, the highest priority, to a value of 100, the lowest. \n\nThe values of 1-100 in this property are inverted from playbook_severity and playbook_impact based on how the concept of priority is used today. For example, in a SOC a P1 ticket is a higher priority than a P4 ticket. \n\nNote that CACAO playbooks also share the same property (priority) but producers of this SDO MAY assign different impact values based on their own rules."
